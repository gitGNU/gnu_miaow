=======

whisker is a localization kits store module.

Usage
-----

from whisker.l10nkitstore import L10nKitStore

store = L10nKitStore()
handler = store.handler('publican', '~/project_path')
for language in handler.languages:
    kit = handler.get_kit(language)
    print kit.format
    for file_path in kit:
        print file_path

Description
-----------

whisker develops a factory method to instantiate a localization kit handler. To
get the handler, it is necessary to instantiate the store and request a handler
through the handler method. The handler method accept two arguments: the name of
the handler (in the previous example is *publican*) and the directory path where
the project resides. 

The handler has the following methods:

* get_kit(target_language)
